"""``Spine`` — the facade tying the store (four versioned entity tables + the
append-only ``tier_audit`` and ``archive_audit`` ledgers), ordering, and projection
together behind semantic write paths, and the home of the server write-admission
checks (the Mutation Invariants and the governed tier and archive controls).

The ``Store`` / ``EntityStore`` layer is dumb persistence: it stamps versions and
writes blobs, no cross-entity policy. The Spine is the "server" boundary that
admits or rejects writes:

    MI-1  No late children on a tombstoned parent. ``create_artifact`` /
          ``create_escalation`` reject a ``task_id`` that resolves to a
          soft-deleted Task (and, as referential hygiene, an absent Task).
    MI-2  Resolving an escalation records the human decision (``resolution``,
          ``resolution_rationale``, ``actor``) and stamps ``resolved_at`` in a
          single put — one write, no paired Task.state transition (escalation is
          not a state). The resolving ``actor`` is an operator-only invariant: the
          server derives it from the authenticated credential, never the payload,
          and ``resolve_escalation`` hard-aborts on any other actor.

(There is no MI-3 — it dissolved when 'escalated' left the state enum.)

GOVERNED TIER CONTROL (v0.3.0). The tier is the one field with a control gradient
(tier 1 self-accept .. tier 4 human), so it gets governance the free edits do not:

    retier_task   change an ALREADY-SET tier ONLY through an audited path — one
                  append-only ``tier_audit`` row per change (who/when/why + whether it
                  REDUCES oversight), written ATOMICALLY with the tier. No ``force``: a
                  re-tier re-decides against fresh state, never clobbers.
    write-once    ``update_task`` refuses to change a SET tier (only the untiered → N
                  initial classification stays free) — so the governed path is the ONLY
                  way to move a set tier, even if a client bypasses the UI.

GOVERNED ARCHIVE CONTROL (v0.4.0). ``archive_task`` / ``unarchive_task`` set/clear the
orthogonal ``archived_at`` flag ONLY through an audited path — one append-only
``archive_audit`` row per change, written atomically with the flag; loud idempotency
(already-archived / not-archived are rejections, never silent no-ops); and an
escalation gate on archive (an open escalation blocks it). No ``force``, same as
re-tier.

Reads return entity objects; ``cards()`` returns the projected, soft-delete-
omitting, escalation-badged Card view.
